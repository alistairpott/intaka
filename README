INTRO
=====
Intaka (Intaka means bird in Xhosa) is an app that I originall wrote to 
download articles from The Economist and convert them into Kindle format.


REQUIREMENTS
============
Intaka is a Python application and requires the BeautifulSoup module to be
available.

Obviously an internet connection.

I use the freely available kindlegen.exe from Amazon to convert the articles
into a format usable on the Kindle.

USAGE
=====
Just put a list of article URL's into the file articles.txt

e.g. http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=17633606

Run the file get-articles.py and the program should download each article
and accompanying pictures and convert into a format suitable to be read on your
ereading device.

The output is:
 - output.opf    An OPF file pointing at the various input files
 - toc.html      Table of Contents that can optionally be used
 - output.html   HTML file containing all of the articles
 - img           Directory containing each of the images downloaded and linked.

I recommend using kindlegen.exe to convert the output.opf file:
> kindlegen.exe -c1 output.opf
 

ROADMAP
=======
I've tried to build a pluggable architecture so that sources other than The
Economist can be used.
